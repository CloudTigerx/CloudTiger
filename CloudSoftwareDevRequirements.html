		<h4>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science majoring in Cloud Computing.</h4>
		<p> 
		While obtaining a four-year degree is unnecessary, enrolling in college and achieving a bachelor’s degree in computer science is highly recommended, as employers require a 4-year degree as a baseline requirement.
		Some exceptional personnel may break into the field without attending school. 
		The classes a student will endure while attending college provide provisions to grasp an understanding of the Cloud and its inner workings such as data structures, coding languages, algorithms, networks, .Net frameworks, 
		and invaluable soft skills. 
		Classes outside of the major curriculum provide a better understanding of businesses and give the chance to work with an assortment of personnel from a variety of different fields providing experience in many aspects of the world. 
		The ability to expand education after a four-year degree can lead to higher pay grades and more career opportunities that require a master's degree and further.
		A college degree will become the foundation as we build our careers, becoming the cement for our pillars to overcome future challenges.

		<h4>Complete a Cloud Devloper Course from a reputed institute</h4>
		<p> 
		With a foundation secured, building the walls of a Cloud Software Development career will consist of receiving hands-on experience through credited cloud providers. 
		AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are the main three companies that provide certifications to verify skills and abilities. 
		The first level of certification through the accreditors is associate, followed by intermediate, and finally advanced. Beyond certifications, there are specialized programs that are taught by lectures, expert mentoring, and hands-on labs. 
		Supplemental training boosts your resume and looks grand for employers.
		</p>
		<h4> Learn a Programming Language</h4>
		<p>
		With the walls built, we will need to install our utilities. For the lights and water, there are several programming languages that are being utilized in Cloud Computing. 
		Java, JVM languages like Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, JavaScript/Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js, C#, Golang, or Node back-end stacks like Express or NestJS keep opportunities steady, too. 
		Python has a lot to offer and Nd AI workflows thanks to robust libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.  
		There are many languages and one should sharpen their skills as much as possible to be flexible and adaptable.
		</p>
		<h4> Gain Real Experience by Working On Cloud Projects </h4>
		<p>
		There is nothing better than experience when it comes to a career, especially in a field as competitive as the tech industry. 
		The earlier a person can start on a real project the better. After obtaining an adequate number of skills, it is time to start installing the floors! 
		The big three, AWS, Azure, and Google offer free-tier development environments to gain the practical experience we are after. Honing the core skills such as computing, storage, networking, load balancing, 
		and databases in our language selection will give us something to walk on. Having 5-10  projects in a portfolio is a tremendous start for our desired success.

		<h4> Cloud Developer Career Path</h4>
		<p>
		Now, we worry about the aesthetics of the career home. 
		We have a solid building and now we must decide which color we want the paint. 
		Cloud developers have many options on the career path they would like to take. Most entry-level cloud developers start designing, implementing, and monitoring basic IaaS/PaaS solutions under their senior developers. 
		An entry-level position is my goal. Promotions become more obtainable after two years of working in this position. From there many doors open and the possibilities are endless.
